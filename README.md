# dotfiles-local

These are my local dotfile overrides, which sit on top of thoughtbot's dotfiles. To use these, first install the base [thoughtbot
dotfiles](https://github.com/stevehanson/dotfiles). Then, clone this repo into
`~/dotfiles-local` and run `rcup`. 

Some Zshell plugins are also required, which can be installed by running:

```shell
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
